<h1>7. Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Modern mathematics is largely founded on set theory: in particular, on
what is called <em>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of Choice</em>,
or <em>ZFC</em>. Every concept you have ever learned in mathematics can, at
least in principle, be reduced to expresions involving sets.  For
example, every natural number can be represented as a set: zero as the
<em>empty set, {}</em>; one as the set containing the empty set, <em>{{}}</em>; two
as the set that contains that set, <em>{{{}}}</em>; ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Set theory includes the treatment of sets, including the special cases
of relations (sets of tuples), functions (<em>single-valued</em> relations),
sequences (functions from natural numbers to elements), and other
related concepts.  ZFC is a widely accepted <em>formal foundation</em> for
modern mathematics: a set of axioms that describe properties of sets,
from which all the rest of mathematics can be deduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="naive-set-theory">
<h2>Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So what is a set? A <em>naive</em> definition (which will actually be good
enough for our purposes and for most of practical computer science) is
that a set is just an unordered collection of elements. In principle,
these elements are themselves reducible to sets but we don’t need to
think in such reductionist terms. We can think about a set of natural
numbers, for example, without having to think of each number as itself
being some weird kind of set.</p>
<p>In practice, we just think sets as unordered collections of elements
of some kind, where any given element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> any
given set. An object can be a member of many different sets, but can
only by in any give set zero or one times. Membership is binary.  So,
for example, when we combine (take the <em>union</em> of) two sets, each of
which contains some common element, the resulting combined set will
have that element as a member, but it won’t have it twice.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces <em>naive</em>, which is to say <em>intuitive and
practical</em>, set theory. It does not cover <em>axiomatic</em> set theory, in
which every concept is ultimately reduced to a set of logical axioms
that define what precisely it means to be a set and what operations
can be use to manipulate sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overly-naive-set-theory">
<h2>Overly Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#overly-naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we go on, however, we review a bit of history to understand
that an overly naive view of sets can lead to logical contradictions
that make such a theory useless as a foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the founders of modern logic, Gotlob Frege, had as his central
aim to establish logical foundations for all of mathematics: to show
that everything could be reduced to a set of axioms, or propositions
accepted without question, from which all other mathematical truths
could be deduced.  The concept of a set was central to his effort. His
logic therefore allowed one to define sets as collections of elements
that satisfy given propositions, and to talk about whether any given
element is in a particular set of not. Frege’s notion of sets, in
turn, traced back to the work of Georg Cantor.</p>
<p>But then, boom! In 1903, the British analytical philosopher, Bertrand
Russell, published a paper presenting a terrible paradox in Frege’s
conception. Russell showed that a logic involving naive set theory
would be <em>inconsistent</em> (self-contradicting) and there useless as a
foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>To see the problem, one consider the set, <em>S</em>, of all sets that do not
contain themselves. In <em>set comprehension</em> notation, we would write
this set as <img class="math" src="_images/math/5fd8e13bfdfe8ceff488029c124be7e2e32abe0b.png" alt="S = \{ a: set | a \notin a \}."/> That is, <em>S</em> is the
set of elements, <em>a</em>, each a set, such that <em>a</em> is not a member of
itself.</p>
<p>Now ask the decisive question: Does <em>S</em> contain itself?</p>
<p>Let’s adopt a notation, <em>C(S)</em>, to represent the proposition that <em>S</em>
contains itself. Now suppose that <em>C(S)</em> is true, i.e., that <em>S</em> does
contain itself. In this case, <em>S</em>, being a set that contains itself,
cannot be a member of <em>S</em>, because we just defined <em>S</em> to be the set
of sets that do <em>not</em> contain themselves. So, the assumption that <em>S</em>
containss itself leads to the conclusion that <em>S</em> does not contain
itself. In logical terms, <img class="math" src="_images/math/88fed86576b69c7f57881ccfe1f506808ec16b07.png" alt="C(S) \rightarrow \neg C(S)."/> This is
a contradiction and thus a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Now suppose <em>S</em> does not contain itself: <img class="math" src="_images/math/4a4e43a13b62324114a4b955a446319f03c21fac.png" alt="\neg C(S)."/>. Being
such a set, and given that <em>S</em> is the set of sets that do not contain
themselves, it must now be in <em>S</em>. So <img class="math" src="_images/math/2bf28ffcfdbea32d11c7145b71a2883546e258a6.png" alt="\neg C(S) \rightarrow
C(S)."/> The assumption that it does <em>not</em> contain itself leads right
back to the conclusion that it <em>does</em> contain itself. Either the set
does or does not contain itself, but assuming either case leads to a
contradictory conclusion. All is lost!</p>
<p>That such an internal self-contradiction can arise in such a simple
way (or at all) is a complete disaster for any logic. The whole point
of a logic is that it gives one a way to reason that is sound, which
means that from true premises one can never reach a contradictory
conclusion. If something that is impossible can be proved to be true
in a given theory, then anything at all can be proved to be true, and
the whole notion of truth just collapses into meaninglessness. As soon
as Frege saw Russell’s Paradox, he knew that that was <em>game over</em> for
his profound attempt to base mathematics on a logic grounded in his
(Cantor’s) naive notion of sets.</p>
<p>Two solutions were eventually devised. Russell introduced a notion of
<em>types</em>, as opposed to sets, per se, as a foundation for mathematics.
The basic idea is that one can have elements of a certain <em>type</em>; then
sets of elements of that type, forming a new type; then sets of sets
elements of that type, forming yet another type; but one cannot even
talk about a set containing (or not containing) itself, because sets
can only contain elements of types lower in the type hierarchy.</p>
<p>The concept of types developed by Russell lead indirectly to modern
type theory, which remains an area of very active exploration in both
computer science and pure mathematics. Type theory is being explored
as an alternative foundation for mathematics, and is at the very heart
of a great deal of work going on in the areas of programming language
design and formal software specification and verification.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zermelo repaired the paradox by adjusting some of
the axioms of set theory, to arrive at the starting point of what has
become ZFC. When we work in set theory today, whether with a <em>naive</em>
perspective or not, we are usually working in a set theory the logical
basic of which is ZFC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sets">
<h2>Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For our purposes, the <em>naive</em> notion of sets will be good enough. We
will take a <em>set</em> to be an unordered finite or infinite collection of
<em>elements</em>. An element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> a set, and can be in
a set at most once.  In this chapter, we will not encounter any of the
bizarre issues that Russell and others had to consider at the start of
the 20th century.</p>
<p>What we will find is that set-theoretical thinking is an incredibly
powerful intellectual tool. It’s at the heart of program specification
and verification, algorithm design and analysis, and theory of
computing, among many other areas in computer science. Moreover, Dafny
makes set theory not only fun but executable. The logic of Dafny, for
writing assertions, pre- and post-conditions, and invariants <em>is</em> set
theory, a first-order logic with sets and set-related operations as
built-in concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-theory-notations">
<h2>Set Theory Notations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory-notations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="display-notation">
<h3>Display notation<a class="headerlink" href="#display-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In everyday mathematical writing, and in Dafny, we denote small sets by
listing the elements of the set within curly brace. If <em>S</em> is the set
containing the numbers, one, two, and three, for example, we can write
<em>S</em> as <img class="math" src="_images/math/681866a8f518adc2b652c8a583e1b642e424b55b.png" alt="\{ 1, 2, 3 \}."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, we would write almost the same thing.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S:set&lt;int&gt; := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code introduces the variable, <em>S</em>, declares that its type is
<em>finite set of integer</em> (<em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em> being the type of <em>infinite</em> sets
of elements of tyep <em>T</em>), and assigns to <em>S</em> the set value, <img class="math" src="_images/math/b7d2529464caa57ee93b6344aa404e3030bb115a.png" alt="\{
1, 2, 3 \}."/> Because the value on the right side of the assignment
operator, is evidently a set of integers, Dafny will infer the type of
<em>S</em>, and the explicit type declaration can therefore be omitted.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When a set is finite but too large to write down easily as a list of
elements, but when it has a regular structure, mathematicians often
denote such a set using an elipsis. For example, a set, <em>S</em>, of even
natural numbers from zero to one hundred could be written like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/9a00b3fe8646fb985d914bf4e01ecb01aec599d2.png" alt="S = \{ 0, 2, 4, \ldots, 100 \}."/> This expression is a kind of
quasi-formal mathematics. It’s mostly formal but leaves details that
an educated person should be able to infer to the human reader.</p>
<p>It is not (currently) possible to write such expressions in Dafny.
Dafny does not try to fill in missing details in specifications. A
system that does do such a thing might make a good research project.
On the other hand, ordinary mathematical writing as well as Dafny do
have ways to precisely specify sets, including even infinite sets, in
very concise ways, using what is called <em>set comprehension</em> or <em>set
builder</em> notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-comprehension-notation">
<h3>Set comprehension notation<a class="headerlink" href="#set-comprehension-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Take the example of the set, <em>S</em>, of even numbers from zero to one
hundred, inclusive. We can denote this set precisely in mathematical
writing as <img class="math" src="_images/math/87faf1ea63943abec666b096763f6edc923017c0.png" alt="S = \{ n: {\mathbb Z}~|~0 &lt;= n &lt;= 100 \land n~mod~2
= 0 \}."/> Let’s pull this expression apart.</p>
<p>The set expression (to the right of the first equals sign) can be read
in three parts. The vertical bar is read <em>such that</em>. To the left of
the bar is an expression identifying the set from which the elements
of <em>this</em> set are drawn, and a name is given to an arbitrary element
of this source set. So here we can say that <em>S</em> is a set each element
<em>n</em> of which is a natural number.  A name, here <em>n</em>, for an arbitrary
element is given for two purposes. First it desribes the form of
elements in the set being built: here just <em>integers</em>. Second, the
name can then be used in writing a condition that must be true of each
such element.  That expression is written to the right of the vertical
bar.</p>
<p>Here the condition is that each such element, <em>n</em> must be greater than
or equal to zero, less than or equal to one hundred, and even, in that
the remainder must be zero when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>2</em>. The overall set
comprehension expression is thus read literally as, <em>S</em> is the set of
integers, <em>n</em>, such that <em>n</em> is greater than or equal to zero, <em>n</em> is
less than or equal to 100, and <em>n</em> evenly divisible by <em>2</em>. A more
fluent reading would simply be <em>S</em> is the set of even integers between
zero and one hundred inclusive.</p>
<p>Dafny supports set comprehension notations. This same set would be
written as follows (we assume that the type of S has already been
declared to be <em>set&lt;int&gt;)</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 100;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another way to define the same set in ordinary mathematical writing
would use a slightly richer form of set comprehension notation. In
particular, we can define the same set as the set of values of the
expression <em>2*n</em> for <em>n</em> is in the range zero to fifty, inclusive.
Where it’s readily inferred, mathematicians will usually also leave
out explicit type information. <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>S = { 2 * n | 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 }. In
this expression it’s inferred that <em>n</em> ranges over all the natural
numbers, these values are <em>filtered</em> by the expression on the right,
and these filtered values are then fed through the expression on the
left of the bar to produce the elements of the intended set.</p>
<p>Dafny also supports set comprehension notation in this style. To
define this very same set in Dafny we could also write this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50 :: 2 * s;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command assigns to S a set of values, <em>2 * s</em>,, where <em>s</em>
ranges over the integers and satisfies the predicate (or filter)
<em>0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50</em>.</p>
<p>The collection of values from which element are drawn to be
build into a new set need not just be a built-in type but can
be another programmer-defined set. Given that <em>S</em> is the set
of even numbers from zero to one hundred, we can define the
subset of <em>S</em> of elements that are less than <em>25</em> by writing
a richer set comprehension. In pure mathematical writing, we
could write <img class="math" src="_images/math/9cc14614aedd949a467fd052edd0f4f2e3862dd0.png" alt="T = \{ t | t \in S \land t &lt; 25\}."/> That is,
<em>T</em> is the set of elements that are in <em>S</em> and less than <em>25</em>.
The Dafny notation is a little different, but not too much:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var T := set t | t in S &amp;&amp; t &lt; 25;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This Dafny code defines <em>T</em> to be the set (of integers, but note that
we let Dafny infer the type of <em>t</em> in this case), such that <em>t</em> is in
the set <em>S</em> (that we just defined) and <em>t</em> is also less than <em>25</em>.</p>
<p>As a final example, let’s suppose that we want to define the set of
all ordered pairs whose first elements are from <em>S</em> and whose second
elements are from <em>T</em>, as we’ve defined them here. For example, the
pair <em>(76,24)</em> would be in this set, but not <em>(24 76)</em>. In ordinary
mathematical writing, this would be <img class="math" src="_images/math/6e93c4191ebb0fdc2a5106f5991ef00a0665e9f8.png" alt="\{ (s,t) | s \in S \land t
\in T\}."/> This set is, as we’ll learn more about shortly, called the
<em>product set</em> of the sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In Danfy, this would be written like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var Q := set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s, t);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code assigns to the new variable, <em>Q</em>, a set formed by taking
elements, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>,, such that <em>s</em> is in <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is in <em>T</em>, and
forming the elements of the new set as tuples, <em>(s, t)</em>. This is a far
easier way to write code for a product set than by explicit iteration
over the sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>!</p>
<p>In Dafny, the way to extract an element of a tuple, <em>t</em>, of arity,
<em>n</em>, is by writing <em>t.n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a natural number in the range
<em>0</em> up to <em>n - 1</em>. So, for example, <em>(3, 4).1</em> evaluates to <em>4</em>. It’s
not a notation that is common to many programming languages. One can
think of it as a kind of subscripting, but using a different notation
than the usual square bracket subscripting used with sequences.</p>

<h2>Set Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="cardinality">
<h3>Cardinality<a class="headerlink" href="#cardinality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By the cardinality of a set, <em>S</em>, we mean the number of elements
in S. When <em>S</em> is finite, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is a natural number.
The cardinarily of the empty set is zero, for example, because it has
no (zero) elements. In ordinary mathematics, if <em>S</em> is a finite set,
then its cardinality is denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/bca4eb7c95f7b9bb9f0b55ab74fb48501c374794.png" alt="|S|"/>. With <em>S</em> defined as in
the preceding section, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is <em>50</em>. (There are
<em>50</em> numbers between <em>0</em> and <em>49</em>, inclusive.)</p>
<p>The Dafny notation for set cardinality is just the same. The following
code will print the cardinality of <em>S</em>, namely <em>50</em>, for example.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print |S|;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a set is infinite in size, as for example is the set of natural
numbers, the cardinality of the set is obviously not any natural
number. One has entered the realm of <em>transfinite numbers</em>. We will
discuss transfinite numbers later in this course. In Dafny, as you
might expect, the cardinality operator is not defined for infinite
sets (of type <em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equality">
<h3>Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two sets are considered equal if and only if they contain exactly
the same elements. To assert that sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are equal in
mathematical writing, we would write <em>S = T</em>. In Dafny, such an
assertion would be written, <em>S == T</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subset">
<h3>Subset<a class="headerlink" href="#subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A set, <em>T</em>, can be said to be a subset of a set <em>S</em> if and only if
every element in <em>T</em> is also in <em>S</em>. In this case, mathematicians
write <img class="math" src="_images/math/006926e4a2b3b3a55129b93b7ab1fedf68da96eb.png" alt="T \subseteq S"/>. In logical notation, we would write,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0e4eb07fe9d633c95c2e21bf6f6f70df946e43f6.png" alt="T \subseteq S \iff \forall t \in T, t \in S"/>. That is, <em>T</em> is a
subset of <em>S</em> if and only if every element in <em>T</em> is also in <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>A set <em>T</em>, is said to be a <em>proper</em> subset of <em>S</em>, if <em>T</em> is a subset
of <em>S</em> but <em>T</em> is not equal to <em>S</em>. This is written in mathematics as
<img class="math" src="_images/math/5e1985f6ce3ef221173377903e0f65930b9412aa.png" alt="T \subset S"/>. In other words, every element of <em>T</em> is in <em>S</em> but
there is at least one element of <em>S</em> that is not in <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In our example, <em>T</em> (the set of even natural numbers less than <em>25</em>)
is a proper subset of <em>S</em> (the set of even natural numbers less than
or equal to <em>100</em>).</p>
<p>In Dafny, one uses the usual arithmetic less than and less than or
equal operator symbols, <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&lt;=</em>, to assert <em>proper subset</em> and
<em>subset</em> relationships, respectively. The first two of the following
assertions are thus both true in Dafny, but the third is not. That
said, limitations in the Dafny verifier make it hard for Dafny to see
the truth of such assertions without help. We will not discuss how to
provide such help at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert T &lt; S;
assert T &lt;= S;
assert S &lt;= T;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We note every set is a subset, but not a proper subset, of
itself. It’s also the case that the empty set is a subset of every
set, in that <em>all</em> elements in the empty set are in any other set,
because there are none. In logic-speak, we’d say <em>a universally
quantified proposition over an empty set is trivially true.</em></p>
<p>If we reverse the operator, we get the notion of supersets and proper
supersets. If <em>T</em> is a subset of <em>S</em>, then <em>S</em> is a superset of <em>T</em>,
written, <img class="math" src="_images/math/545f54f8cb60943285b183ae5bc52fb0fc87ad16.png" alt="S \supseteq T"/>. If <em>T</em> is a proper subset of <em>S</em> then
<em>S</em> is a proper superset of <em>T</em>, written <img class="math" src="_images/math/65e6f407c7dfce0fa7d0f9e6db27595235e657f2.png" alt="S \supset T"/>. In
Dafny, the greater than and greater than or equals operator are used
to denote proper superset and superset relationships between sets.
So, for example, <em>S &gt;= T</em> is the assertion that <em>S</em> is a superset of
<em>T</em>. Note that every set is a superset of itself, but never a proper
superset of itself, and every set is a superset of the empty set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intersection">
<h3>Intersection<a class="headerlink" href="#intersection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The intersection, <img class="math" src="_images/math/5391bb4cd9797217ba8e85da016c08f73cf66ba9.png" alt="S \cap T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the
set of elements that are in both <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. Mathematically speaking,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/b93e4637c8680497c56648862807d1a3965cacd8.png" alt="S \cap T = \{ e~|~e \in S \land e \in T \}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, the <em>*</em> operator is used for set intersection.  The
intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is thus written <em>S * T</em>. For example, the
command <em>Q := S * T</em> assigns the intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the

<h3>Union<a class="headerlink" href="#union" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The union, <img class="math" src="_images/math/10bb12eb90bac33ab070fa2ff9405b721df1230e.png" alt="S \cup T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the set of

<h3>Difference<a class="headerlink" href="#difference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difference, <em>S\T</em> (<em>S</em> minus <em>T</em>), of sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is the set

<p>The product set, <img class="math" src="_images/math/64a6eff94bb737b50c491df7ab889fd0c11ecb02.png" alt="S \times T"/>, is the set of all the ordered

used to form the set comprehension expression, followed by a verticalbar,

<h3>Power Set<a class="headerlink" href="#power-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The power set of a set, <em>S</em>, denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/13c471ff6a4226c1aeff17f10d4693215420d207.png" alt="{\mathbb P}(S),"/> is the
set of all subsets of <em>S</em>. If <em>S = {1, 2 }</em>, for example, the powerset
of <em>S</em> is the set containing the proper and improper subsets of <em>S</em>,
namely <em>{}, { 1 }, { 2 },</em> and <em>{ 1, 2}</em>.</p>
<p>The powerset of a set with <em>n</em> element will have <img class="math" src="_images/math/798d39775b3c54beddeb31ad508597409e6e7c43.png" alt="2^n"/> elements.
Consider the powerset of the empty set. The only subset of the empty
set is the empty set itself, so the powerset of the empty set is the
set containing only the empty set. This set has just <em>1</em> element. It’s
cardinality thus satisfies the rule, as <em>2</em> to the power, zero (the
number of elements in the empty set), is <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that for every set, <em>S</em>, with cardinality <em>n</em>, the
cardinality of its powerset is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>. Consider a set, <em>S’</em>,
of cardinality one bigger than that of <em>S</em>. Its powerset contains
every set in the powerset of <em>S</em>, plus every set in that set with the
new element included, and that’s all the element it includes.</p>
<p>The number of sets in the powerset of <em>S’</em> is thus double the number
of sets in the powerset of <em>S</em>. Given that the cardinality of the
powerset of <em>S</em> is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>, the cardinality of <em>S’</em>, being
twice that number, is <em>2</em> to the <em>n + 1</em>.</p>
<p>Now because the rule holds for sets of size zero, and whenver it holds
for sets of size <em>n</em> it also holds for sets of size <em>n + 1</em>, it must
hold for sets of every (finite) size. So what we have is an informal
<em>proof by induction</em> of a theorem: <img class="math" src="_images/math/6286656ea11925e78858a3878bc9be8a2866eeb9.png" alt="\forall S, |{\mathbb P}(S)|
= 2^{|S|}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, there is no explicit powerset operator, one that would take
a set and returning its powerset, but the concept can be expressed in
an elegant form using a set comprehension. The solution is simply to
say <em>the set of all sets that are subsets of a given set, *</em>. In pure
mathematical notation this would be <img class="math" src="_images/math/e81fbf5e8d1ab6627d0ef257362d2d412eedc562.png" alt="{ R | R \subseteq S }."/> In
Dafny it’s basically the same expression.  The follwing three-line
program computes and prints out the powerset of <em>S = { 1, 2, 3 }</em>.
The key expression is to the right of the assignment operator on the
second line.</p>

<div class="section" id="tuples">
<h2>Tuples<a class="headerlink" href="#tuples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tuple is an ordered collection of elements. The type of elements in
a tuple need not all be be the same. The number of elements in a tuple
is called its <em>arity</em>. Ordered pairs are tuples of arity, <em>2</em>, for
example. A tuple of arity <em>3</em> can be called a (an ordered) <em>triple</em>.
A tuple of a larger arity, <em>n</em>, is called an <em>n-tuple</em>.  The tuple,
<em>(7, X, “house”, square_func)</em>, for example, is a <em>4-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>As is evident in this example, the elements of a tuple are in general
not of the same type, or drawn from the same sets. Here, the first
element is an integer; the second, a variable;, the third, a string;
and last, a function.</p>
<p>An <em>n</em>-tuples should be understood as values taken from a product of
<em>n</em> sets.  If <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are our sets of even numbers between zero
and one hundred, and zero and twenty four, for example, then the
ordered pair, <em>(60,24)</em> is an element of the product set <img class="math" src="_images/math/fd4532a7c98d7c47b7d54737789d6d190f8a7858.png" alt="S
\times T"/>.  The preceding <em>4</em>-tuple would have come from a product of
four sets: one of integers, one of variables, one of strings, and one
of functions.</p>
<p>The <em>type</em> of a tuple is the tuple of the types of its elements. In
mathematical writing, we’d say that the tuple, <em>(-3,4)</em> is al element
of the set <img class="math" src="_images/math/d525dd73f25737324d2d392212dacd850ef44d6e.png" alt="{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z},"/> and if asked about
its type, most mathematicians would say <em>pair of integers</em>. In Dafny,
where types are more explicit than they usually are in quasi-formal
mathematical discourse, the type of this tuple is <em>(int, int)</em>. In
general, in both math and in Dafny, in particular, the type of a tuple
in a set product, ::<cite>S_1 times S_2 times ldots time S_n</cite>, where
the types of these sets are <img class="math" src="_images/math/a25f27eaf855f40709db99b90e3b307f237b9c35.png" alt="T_1, \ldots, T_n"/> is <img class="math" src="_images/math/74d9c0565f0b3fbb6fd97c1dd34039045be28627.png" alt="(T_1,
\ldots, T_n)"/>.</p>
<p>The elements of a tuple are sometimes called <em>fields of that tuple.
Given an *n</em>-tuple, <em>t</em>, we are often interested in working with the
value of one of its fields. We thus need a function for <em>projecting</em>
the value of a field out of a tuple. We actually think of an <em>n</em>-tuple
as coming with <em>n</em> projection functions, one for each field.</p>
<p>Projection functions are usually written using the Greek letter,
::<cite>pi</cite>, with a natural number subscript indicating which field a
given projection function ” projects”. Given a <em>4</em>-tuple, <em>t = (7, X,
“house”, square_func)</em>, we would have math::<cite>pi_0(t) = 7</cite> and
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0832133408abb0b5c9d45e6b0fbffe3dd705bd45.png" alt="\pi_3(t) = square_func."/></p>
<p>The type of a projection funcion is <em>function from tuple type to field
type</em>. In general, because tuples have fields of different types, they
will also have projection functions of different types. For example,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/f96bb02fb7101e0965f5d94b111888cbe1914724.png" alt="pi_0"/> here is of type (in Dafny) <img class="math" src="_images/math/312b0afa59f8001e7eda18a2d5eebd4787b37d11.png" alt="(int, variable, string,
int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}"/> while <img class="math" src="_images/math/0dab7d9572fb05154c9fa626fbe6bdaaeccf8fa4.png" alt="pi_3"/> is of
type <img class="math" src="_images/math/2630939c0e41b2205905b6b6ec364d3e0222b2bf.png" alt="(int, variable, string, int \rightarrow int) \rightarrow
(int \rightarrow int)."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, tuples are written as they are in mathematics, as lists of
field values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.  For
example <em>t := (1, “hello”, [1,2,3])” assigns to *t</em> a <em>3-tuple</em> whose
first field has the value, <em>1</em> (of type <em>int</em>); whose second field has
the value, “hello”, a string; and whose third element is the list of
integers, <em>[2, 4, 6]</em>.</p>
<p>Projection in Dafny is accomplished using the <em>tuple</em> subscripting (as
opposed to array or list subscripting) operation. Tuple subscripting is
done by putting a dot (period) followed by an index after the tuple
expression. Here’s a little Dafny code to illustrate. It defines <em>t</em>
to be the triple, <em>(7, ‘X’, “hello”)</em> (of type <em>(int, char, string)</em>),
and then usses the <em>.0</em> and <em>.2</em> projection functions to project the
first and third elements of the tuple, which it prints. To make the
type of the tuple explicit, the final line of code declare <em>t’</em> to be
the same tuple value, but this time explicitly declares its type.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var t := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
print t.0;
print t.2;
var t&#39;: (int, char, string) := (7, &#39;X&#39;, &quot;hello&quot;);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While all of this might seem a little abstract, it’s actually simple
and very useful. Any table of data, such as a table with columns that
hold names, birthdays, and social security numbers, represents data in
a product set. Each row is a tuple. The columns correspond to the sets
from which the field values are drawn. One set is a set of names; the
second, a set birthdays; the third, a set of social security numbers.
Each row is just a particular tuple in product of these three sets,
and the table as a whole is what we call a <em>relation</em>. If you have
heard of a <em>relational database</em>, you now know what kind of data such
a system handles: tables, i.e., <em>relations</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relations">
<h2>Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A relation in nothing but a subset of (the tuples in) a product set. A
table such as the one just described, will, in practice, usually not
have a row with every possible combination of names, birthdays, and
SSNs. In other words, it won’t be the entire product of the sets from
which the field values drawn. Rather, it will usually contain a small
subset of the product set.</p>
<p>In mathematical writing, we will thus often see a sentence of the
form, Let <img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/> be a (binary) relation on <em>S</em>
and <em>T</em>. All this says is that <em>R</em> is some subset of the set of all
tuples in the product set of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. If <em>S = { hot, cold }</em> and
<em>T = { cat, dog }</em>, then the product set is <em>{ (hot, cat), (hot, dog),
(cold, cat), (cold, dog) }</em>, and a relation on <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is any
subset of this product set.  The set, <em>{ (hot, cat), (cold, dog) }</em> is
thus one such relation on <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Here’s an exercise. If <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are finite sets, with cardinalities
<em>|S| = n</em> and <em>|T| = m</em>, how many relations are there over <em>S</em> and
<em>T</em>? Hint: First, how many tuples are in the product set? Second, how
many subsets are there of that set? For fun, write a little Dafny
program that takes two sets of integers as arguments as return the
number of relations over them.  Write another function that takes two
sets and returns the set of all possible relations over the sets. Use
a set comprehension expression rather than writing a while loop. Be
careful: the number of possible relations will be very large even in
cases where the given sets contain only a few elements each.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="binary-relations">
<h2>Binary Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#binary-relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Binary relations, which play an especially important role in
mathematics and computer science, are relations over just <em>2</em>
sets. Suppose <img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/> is a binary relation on
<em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. Then <em>S</em> is called the <em>domain</em> of the relation, and <em>T</em>
is called its <em>co-domain</em>. That is, a binary relation is a subset of
the ordered pairs in a product of the given domain and codomain sets.</p>
<p>If a particular tuple, <em>(s, t)</em> is an element of such a relation, <em>R</em>,
we will say <em>R</em> is <em>defined for</em> the value, s, and that <em>R achieves</em>
the value, <em>t</em>. The <em>support</em> of a relation is the subset of values in
the domain on which it is defined. The <em>range</em> of a relation is the
subset of co-domain values that it achieves.</p>
<p>For example, if <em>S = { hot, cold }</em> and <em>T = { cat, dog }</em>, and <em>R =
*{ (hot, cat), (hot, dog) }</em>, then the domain of <em>R</em> is <em>S</em>; the
co-domain of <em>R</em> is <em>T</em>; the support of <em>R</em> is just <em>{ hot }</em> (and <em>R</em>
is thus <em>not defined</em> for the value <em>cold</em>); and the range of <em>R</em> is
the whole co-domain, <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>The everyday functions you have studies in mathematics are binary
relations, albeit usually infinite ones. For example, the <em>square</em>
function, that associates every real number with its square, can be
understood as the infinite set of ordered pairs of real numbers in
which the second is the square of the first. Mathematically this is
:{ (x, y) | y = x^2 }:<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`</span></a>, where we take as implicit that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
range over the real numbers. Elements of this set include the pairs,
<em>(-2, 4)</em> and <em>(2, 4)</em>.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>square roots</em> of real numbers is also best understood
as a relation. The tuples are again pairs of real numbers, but now the
elements include tuples, <em>(4, 2)</em> and <em>(4, -2)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="functions-single-valued-relations">
<h2>Functions: <em>Single-Valued</em> Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#functions-single-valued-relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A binary-relation is said to be <em>single-valued</em> if it does not have
tuples with the same first element and different second elements.  A
single-valued binary relation is also called a <em>function</em>.  Another
way to say that <em>R</em> is single valued is to say that if <em>(x, y)</em> and
<em>(x, z)</em> are both in <em>R</em> then it must be that <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> are the same
value. Otherwise the relation would not be single-valued! To be more
precise, then, if <img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/>, is single valued
relation, then <img class="math" src="_images/math/a891d93912f06167bde2b4af6ef72b276625e48e.png" alt="(x, y) \in R \land (x, z) \in R \rightarrow y =
z"/>.</p>
<p>As an example of a single-valued relation, i.e., a function, consider
the <em>square</em>. For any given natural number (in the domain) under this
function there is just a <em>single</em> associated value in the range (the
square of the first number). The relation is single-valued in exactly
this sense. By contrast, the square root relation is not a function,
because it is not single-valued. For any given non-negative number in
its domain, there are <em>two</em> associated square roots in its range. The
relation is not single-valued and so it is not a function.</p>
<p>There are several ways to represent functions in Dafny, or any other
programming language. One can represent a given function <em>implicity</em>:
as a <em>program</em> that computes that function. But one can also represent
a function <em>explicitly</em>, as a relation: that is, as a set of pairs.
The (polymorphic) <em>map</em> type in Dafny provides such a representation.</p>
<p>A “map”, i.e., a value of type <em>map&lt;S,T&gt;</em> (where <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are type
parameters), is to be understood as an explicit representation of a
single-valued relation: a set of pairs: a function. In addition to a
mere set of pairs, this data type also provides helpful functions and
a clever representation underlying representation that both enforce
the single-valuedness of maps, and that make it very efficient to look
up range values given domain values where the map is defined, i.e., to
<em>apply</em> such a function to a domain value (a “key”) to obtained the
related range <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>Given a Dafny map object, <em>m</em>, of type <em>map&lt;S,T&gt;</em>, one can obtain the
set of values of type <em>S</em> for which the map is defined as <em>m.Keys().</em>
One can obtain the range, i.e., the set of values of type <em>T</em> that the
map maps <em>to</em>, as <em>m.Values().</em> One can determine whether a given key,
<em>s</em> of type <em>S</em> is defined in a map with the expression, <em>s in m</em>.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a method (or a function) that when given a map&lt;S,T&gt; as
an argument returns a set&lt;(T,S)&gt; as a result where the return result
represents the <em>inverse</em> of the map. The inverse of a function is not
necessarily a function so the inverse of a map cannot be represented
as a map, in general. Rather, we represent the inverse just as a <em>set</em>
of <em>(S,T)</em> tuples.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a pure function that when given a set of ordered pairs
returns true if, viewed as a relation, the set is also a function, and
that returns false, otherwise.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a function or method that takes a set of ordered pairs
with a pre-condition requiring that the set satisfy the predicate from
the preceding exercise and that then returns a <em>map</em> that contains the
same set of pairs as the given set.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a function that takes a map as an argument and that
returns true if the function that it represents is invertible and that
otherwise returns false. Then write a function that takes a map
satisfying the precondition that it be invertible and that in this
case returns its inverse, also as a map.</p>

<h2>Properties of Relations and Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-relations-and-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We now introduce essential concepts and terminology regarding for
distinguishing essential properties and special cases of relations and
functions.</p>
<div class="section" id="total-vs-partial">
<h3>Total vs Partial<a class="headerlink" href="#total-vs-partial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation (including a function) is said to be <em>total</em> if
every element of its domain appears as the first element in at least
one tuple, i.e., its <em>support</em> is its entire <em>domain</em>.  A relation
that is not total is said to be <em>partial</em>. For example, the square
function on the real numbers is total, in that it is defined on its
entire real number domain. By contrast, the square root function is
not total (if it domain is taken to be the real numbers) because it is
not defined for real numbers that are less than zero.</p>
<p>Note that if one considers a slightly different function, the square
root function on the <em>non-negative</em> real numbers the only difference
being in the domainm then this function <em>is</em> total. Totality is thus
relative to the specified domain. Here we have two functions with the
very same set of ordered pairs, but one is total and the other is not.</p>
<p>Exercises: Is the function <em>y = x</em> on the real numbers total?  Is the
<em>log</em> function defined on the non-negative real numbers total? Answer:
no, because it’t not defined at <em>x = 0</em>.  Is the <em>SSN</em> function, that
assigns a U.S. Social Security Number to every person, total? No, not
every person has a U.S. Social Security number.</p>
<p>Implementing partial functions as methods or pure function in software
presents certain problems. Either a pre-conditions has to be enforced
to prevent the function or method being called with a value for which
it’s not defined, or the function or method needs to be made total by
returning some kind of <em>error</em> value if it’s called with such a value.
In this case, callers of such a function are obligated always to check
whether <em>some</em> validfunction value was returned or whether instead a
value was returned that indicates that there is <em>no such value</em>. Such
a value indicates an <em>error</em> in the use of the function, but one that
the program caught. The failure of programmers systematically to check
for <em>error returns</em> is a common source of bugs in real software.</p>
<p>Finally we note that by enforcing a requirement that every loop and
recursion terminates, Dafny demands that every function and method be
total in the sense that it returns and that it returns some value,
even it it’s a value that could flag an error.</p>
<p>When a Dafny total function is used to implement a mathematical
function that is itself partial (e.g., <em>log(x)</em> for any real number,
<em>x</em>), the problem thus arises what to return for inputs for which the
underlying mathematical function is not defined.  A little later in
the course we will see a nice way to handle this issue using what are
called <em>option</em> types. An option type is like a box that contains
either a good value or an error flag; and to get a good value out of
such a box, one must explicitly check to see whether the box has a
good value in it or, alternatively, and error flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inverse">
<h3>Inverse<a class="headerlink" href="#inverse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The inverse of a given binary relation is simply the set of tuples
formed by reversing the order of all of the given tuples. To put this
in mathematical notation, if <em>R</em> is a relation, its inverse, denoted
::<cite>R^{-1}</cite>, is <img class="math" src="_images/math/6b8262e547923c6ac102733ab306db06ec2c58d2.png" alt="\{ (y, x) | (x, y) \in R \}"/>. You can see this
immediately in our example of squares and square roots. Each of these
relations is the inverse of the other. One contains the tuples, <em>(-2,
4), (2, 4)</em>, while the other contains <em>(4, 2), (4, -2)</em>.</p>
<p>It should immediately be clear that the inverse of a function is not
always also a function. The inverse of the <em>square</em> function is the
<em>square root</em> relation, but that relation is not itself a function,
because it is not single valued.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual way to think about these concept. Consider the graph
of the <em>square</em> function. Its a parabola that opens either upward in
the <em>y</em> direction, or downward. Now select any value for <em>x</em> and draw
a vertical line. It will intersect the parabola at only one point.
The function is single-valued.</p>
<p>The graph of a square root function, on the other hand, is a parabola
that opens to the left or right. So if one draws a vertial line at
some value of <em>x</em>, either the line fails to hit the graph at all (the
square root function is not defined for all values of <em>x</em>), or it
intersects the line at two points. The square root “function” is not
single-valued, and isn’t really even a <em>function</em> at all. (If the
vertical line hits the parabola right at its bottom, the set of points
at which it intersects contains just one element, but if one takes the
solution set to be a <em>multi-set</em>, then the value, zero, occurs in that
set twice.)</p>
<p>A function whose inverse is a function is said to be <em>invertible</em>.
The function, <em>f(x) = x</em> (or <em>y = x</em> if you prefer) is invertible in
this sense. In fact, its inverse is itself.</p>
<p>Exercise: Is the cube root function invertible? Prove it informally.</p>

it means for a function to be invertible. Model your definition on our

<h3>Injective<a class="headerlink" href="#injective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A relation (or function, in particular) is said to be <em>injective</em> if
no two elements of the domain are associated with the same element in
the co-domain. Such a relation is also said to be <em>one-one-one</em>,
rather than <em>many-to-one</em>).</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about the difference between being injective
and single valued. Single-valued means no <em>one</em> element of the domain
“goes to” <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">*</span></a>more than one” value in the range. Injective means that “no
more than one” value in the domain “goes to” and one value in the
range.</p>
<p>Exercise: Draw a picture. Draw the domain and range sets as clouds
with points inside, representing objects (values) in the domain and
co-domain. Represent a relation as a set of <em>arrows</em> that connect
domain objects to co-domain objects. The arrows visually depict the
ordered pairs in the relation. What does it look like visually for a
relation to be single-valued? What does it look like for a relation to
be injective?</p>
<p>The square function is a function because it is single-valued, but it
is not injective. To see this, observe that two different values in
the domain, <em>-2</em> and <em>2</em>, have the same value in the co-domain: <em>4</em>.
Think about the graph: if you can draw a <em>horizontal</em> line for any
value of <em>y</em> that intersects the graph at multiple points, then the
points at which it intersects correspond to different values of <em>x</em>
that have the same value <em>under the relation</em>. Such a relation is not
injective.</p>
<p>Exercises: Write a precise mathematical definition of what it means
for a binary relation to be injective.  Is the cube root function

<h4>An Aside: Injectivity in Type Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#an-aside-injectivity-in-type-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As an aside, we note that the concept of injectivity is essential in
<em>type theory</em>.  Whereas <em>set theory</em> provides a universally accepted
axiomatic foundation for mathematics, <em>type</em> theory is of increasing
interest as alternative foundation. It is also at the very heart of a
great deal of work in programming languages and software verification.</p>
<p>Type theory takes types rather than sets to be elementary. A type in
type theory comprises a collection of objects, just as a set does in
set theory. But whereas in set theory, an object can be in many sets,
in type theory, and object can have only one type.</p>
<p>The set of values of a given type is defined by a set of constants and
functions called constructors. Constant constructors define what one
can think of as the <em>smallest</em> values of a type, while constructors
that are functions provide means to build larger values of a type by
<a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">*</span></a>packaging up” smaller values of the same and/or other types.</p>
<p>As a simple example, one might say that the set of values of the type,
<em>Russian Doll,</em> is given by one constant constructor, <em>SolidDoll</em> and
by one constructor function, <em>NestDoll</em> that takes a nested doll as an
argument (the solid one or any other one built by <em>NestDoll</em> itself).
Speaking intuitively, this constructor function does nothing other
than <em>package up</em> the smaller nest doll it was given inside a “box”
labelled <em>NestDoll</em>.  One can thus obtain a nested doll either as the
constant <em>SolidDoll</em> or by applying the <em>NestDoll</em> constructor some
finite number of times to smaller nested dolls. Such a nesting will
always be finitely deep, with the solid doll at the core.</p>
<p>A key idea in type theory is that <em>constructors are injective</em>. Two
values of a given type built by different constructors, or by the same
constructor with different arguments, are <em>always</em> different. So, for
example, the solid doll is by definition unequal to any doll built by
the <em>NestDoll</em> constructor; and a russian doll nested two levels deep
(built by applying <em>NestDoll</em> to an argument representing a doll that
is nested one level deep)is necessarily unequal to a russian doll one
level deep (built by applying <em>NestDoll</em> to the solid doll).</p>
<p>Running this inequality idea in reverse, we can conclude that if two
values of a given type are known to be equal, then for sure they were
constructed by the same constructor taking the same arguments (if
any).  It turns out that knowing such a fact, rooted in the
<em>injectivity of constructors</em> is often essential to completing proofs
about programs using type theory. But more on this later.</p>

<div class="section" id="surjective">
<h3>Surjective<a class="headerlink" href="#surjective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation, and in particular a function, is <em>surjective</em> if
every element in the co-domain appears in some tuple in the relation.
A surjective relation is also said to be <em>onto</em>. The <em>range</em> of values
it achieves covers its whole co-domain. Mathematically, a relation
<img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/> is surjective if <img class="math" src="_images/math/bbe12e2c660a1569bad26cde264cda0c8a9f82bf.png" alt="\forall t \in
T, \exists s \in S~|~(s,t) \in R"/>.</p>
<p>In the intuitive terms of high school algebra, a relation involving
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is surjective if for any given <em>y</em> value there is always
some <em>x</em> that “leads to” that <em>y</em>. The <em>square</em> function on the real
numbers is not surjective, because there is no <em>x</em> that when squared
gets one to <em>y = -1</em>.</p>
<p>Exercise: Is the function, <em>f(x) = sin(x)</em>, from the real numbers (on
the x-axis) to real numbers (on the y-axis) surjective? How might you
phrase an informal but rigorous proof of your answer?</p>
<p>Exercise: Is the inverse of a surjective function always total? How
would you “prove” this with a rigorous, step-by-step argument based on
the definitions we’ve given here? Hint: It is almost always useful to
start with definitions. What does it mean for a relation to be total?
What does it mean for one relation to be the inverse of another? How
can you connect these definitons to show for sure that your answer is
right?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bijective">
<h3>Bijective<a class="headerlink" href="#bijective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A total function is said to be <em>bjective</em> if it is also both injective
and surjective. Such a function is also often called a <em>bijection</em>.</p>
<p>Take a moment to think about the implications of being a bijection.
Consider a bijective relation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/cdb76e3e99672f56cabfad2588fe14c9fdb2e2a9.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T."/> <em>R</em> is
total, so there is an <em>arrow</em> from every <em>s</em> in <em>S</em> to some <em>t</em> in
<em>T</em>.  <em>R</em> is injective, so no two arrows from any <em>s</em> in <em>s</em> ever hit
the same <em>t</em> in <em>T</em>. An injection is one-to-one. So there is exactly
one <em>t</em> in <em>T</em> hit by each <em>s</em> in <em>S</em>. But <em>R</em> is also surjective, so
every <em>t</em> in <em>T</em> is hit by some arrow from <em>S</em>. Therefore, there has
to be exactly one element in <em>t</em> for each element in <em>s</em>. So the sets
are of the same size, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between
their elements.</p>
<p>Now consider some <em>t</em> in <em>T</em>. It must be hit by exactly one arrow from
<em>S</em>, so the <em>inverse</em> relation, <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">:matg:`R^{-1}`</span></a>, from <em>T</em> to <em>S</em>, must
also single-valued (a function). Moreover, because <em>R</em> is surjective,
every <em>t</em> in <em>T</em> is hit by some <em>s</em> in <em>S</em>, so the inverse relation is
defined for every <em>t</em> in <em>T</em>. It, too, is total. Now every arrow from
any <em>s</em> to some <em>t</em> leads back from that <em>t</em> to that <em>s</em>, so the
inverse And it’s also (and because <em>R</em> is total, there is such an
arror for <em>every</em> <em>s</em> in <em>S</em>), the inverse relation is surjective (it
covers all of <em>S</em>).</p>
<p>Exercise: Must the inverse of a bijection be one-to-one? Why or why
not?  Make a rigorous argument based on assumptions derived from our
definitions.</p>
<p>Exercise: Must a bijective function be invertible? Make a rigorous
argument.</p>
<p>Exercise: What is the inverse of the inverse of a bijective function,
<em>R</em>. Prove it with a rigorous argument.</p>
<p>A bijection estabishes an invertible, one-to-one correspondence
between elements of two sets. Bijections can only be established
between sets of the same size. So if you want to prove that two sets
are of the same size, it sufficies to show that one can define a
bijection between the two sets. That is, one simply shows that there
is some function that covers each element in each set with arrows
connecting them, one-to-one in both directions.</p>
<p>Exercise: Prove that the number of non-negative integers (the
cardinality of <img class="math" src="_images/math/c8f55b4d0816bb06f543ad34702b2642a045ba47.png" alt="{\mathbb N}"/>), is the same as the number of
non-negative fractions (the cardinality of <img class="math" src="_images/math/c39e35fcc1b9fb0f451059b362af5d6a2d6a3e97.png" alt="{\mathbb Q^{+}}"/>).</p>
<p>Exercise: How many bijective relations are there between two sets of
cardinality <em>k</em>? Hint: Pick a first element in the first set. There
are <em>n</em> ways to map it to some element in the second set. Now for the
second element in the first set, there are only <em>(n-1)</em> ways to pair
it up with an element in the second set, as one cannot map it to the
element chosen in the first step (the result would not be injective).
Continue this line of reasoning until you get down to all elements
having been mapped.</p>
<p>Exercise: How many bijections are there from a set, <em>S</em>, to itself?
You can think of such a bijection as a simple kind of encryption. For
example, if you map each of the <em>26</em> letters of the alphabet to some
other letter, but in a way that is unambiguous (injective!), then you
have a simple encryption mechanisms. How many ways can you encrypt a
text that uses <em>26</em> letters in this way? Given a cyphertext, how would
you recover the original plaintext?</p>
<p>Exercise: If you encrypt a text in this manner, using a bijection,
<em>R</em> and then encrpty the resulting cyphertext using another one <em>T</em>,
can you necessarily recover the plaintext? How? Is there a <em>single</em>
bijection that would have accomplished the same encryption result?
Would the inverse of that bijection effectively decrypt messages?</p>
<p>Exercise: Is the composition of any two bijections also a bijection?
If so, can you express its inverse in terms of the inverses of the two
component bijections?</p>
<p>Exercise: What is the <em>identity</em> bijection on the set of <em>26</em> letters?</p>
<p>Question: Are such bijections commutative? That is, you have two of
them, say <em>R</em> and <em>T</em>, is the bijection that you get by applying <em>R</em>
and then <em>T</em> the same as the bijection you get by applying <em>T</em> and
then <em>R</em>? If your answer is <em>no</em>, prove it by giving a counterexample
(e.g., involving bijections on a small set). If your answer is yes,
make rigorous argument.</p>
<p>Programming exercise: Implement encryption and decryption schemes in
Dafny using bijections over the <em>26</em> capital letters of the English
alphabet.</p>
<p>Programming exercise: Implement a <em>compose</em> function in Dafny that
takes two pure functions, <em>R</em> and <em>T</em>, each implementing a bijection
between the set of capital letters and that returns a pure function
that when applied has the effect of first applying <em>T</em> then applying
<em>R</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="reflexive">
<h3>Reflexive<a class="headerlink" href="#reflexive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We now consider some additional fundamental properties of binary
relations, starting with relations that maps sets to themselves.  A
relation that maps real numbers to real numbers is a subset of
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0fe9cb77c7db298a4025875b7744e197f8edf6dd.png" alt="{\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}"/>, for example. The <em>friends</em>
relation on a social network site associates people with people.</p>
<p>Such a relation is said to be <em>reflexive</em> if (perhaps among other
properties) it (at least) associates every element with itself.  The
equality relation (e.g., on real numbers) is the “canonical” example
of a reflexive relation. It associates every number with itself and
with no other number. The tuples of the equality relation on real
numbers thus includes <em>(2.5, 2.5)</em> and (-3.0, -3.0)* but definitely
not <em>(2.5, -3.0)</em>.</p>
<p>In more mathematical terms, consider a set <em>S</em> and a bindary relation,
<em>R</em>, on S*S, :math:R subseteq S times S.` <em>R</em> is reflexive, which we
can write as <em>Reflexive(R)</em>, if and only if for every <em>e</em> in <em>S</em>, the
tuple <em>(e,e)</em> is in R. Or to be rigorous about it, <img class="math" src="_images/math/29a6521497cbd297db621982c436e24e562c3dac.png" alt="Reflexive(R)
\iff \forall e \in S, (e,e) \in R."/></p>
<p>Exercise: Is the function, <em>y = x</em>, reflexive? If every person loves
themself, is the <em>loves</em> relation reflexive? Is the <em>less than or
equals</em> relation reflexive? Hint: the tuples <em>(2,3)</em> and <em>(3,3)</em> are
in this relation becaue <em>2</em> is less than or equal to <em>3</em>, and so is
<em>3</em>, but <em>(4,3)</em> is not in this relation, because <em>4</em> isn’t less than
or equal to <em>3</em>. Is the less than relation reflexive?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symmetric">
<h3>Symmetric<a class="headerlink" href="#symmetric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation, <em>R</em>, on a set <em>S</em> is said to be <em>symmetric</em> if
whenever the tuple <em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>R</em>, the tuple, <em>(y,x)</em> is in <em>R</em> as
well. On Facebook, for example, if Joe is “friends” with “Tom” then
“Tom” is necessarily also friends with “Joe.” The Facebook friends
relation is thus symmetric in this sense.</p>
<p>More formally, if <em>R</em> is a binary relation on a set <em>S</em>, i.e., given
<img class="math" src="_images/math/badf8967a9e750fa49296dc504efdd8360424458.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times S"/>, then <img class="math" src="_images/math/a983ca479a92d849d74c93ab3558691789025821.png" alt="Symmetric(R) \iff \forall
(x,y) \in R, (y,x) \in R"/>.</p>
<p>Question: is the function <em>y = x</em> symmetric? How about the <em>square</em>
function? In an electric circuit, if a conducting wire connects
terminal <em>T</em> to terminal <em>Q</em>, it also connects terminal <em>Q</em> to
terminal <em>T</em> in the sense that electricity doesn’t care which way it
flows over the wire. Is the <em>connects</em> relation in electronic circuits
symmetric? If <em>A</em> is <em>near</em> <em>B</em> then <em>B</em> is <em>near</em> <em>A</em>. Is <em>nearness</em>
symmetric? In the real work is the <em>has-crush-on</em> relation symmetric?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="transitive">
<h3>Transitive<a class="headerlink" href="#transitive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given a binary relation <img class="math" src="_images/math/badf8967a9e750fa49296dc504efdd8360424458.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times S"/>, <em>R</em> is said to
be transitive if whenever <em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>R</em> and <em>(y,z)</em> is in <em>R</em>,
then <em>(x,z)</em> is also in <em>R</em>. Formally, <img class="math" src="_images/math/2209188eabeeb58472953f1513897f62a1f1a32c.png" alt="Transitive(R) \iff
forall (x,y) in R, \forall (y,z) \in R, (x,z) \in R"/>.</p>
<p>Exercise: Is equality transitive? That is, if <em>a = b</em> and <em>b = c</em> it
is also necessarily the case that <em>a = c</em>? Answer: Sure, any sensible
notion of an equality relation has this transitivity property.</p>
<p>Exercise: What about the property of being less than? If <em>a &lt; b</em> and
<em>b &lt; c</em> is it necessarily the case that <em>a &lt; c</em>? Answer: again,
yes. The less than, as well as the less than or equal, and greater
then, and the greater than or equal relations, are all transitive.</p>
<p>How about the <em>likes</em> relation amongst real people. If Harry likes
Sally and Sally likes Bob does Harry necesarily like Bob, too? No, the
human “likes” relation is definitely not transitive. (And this is the
cause of many a tragedy.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equivalence">
<h3>Equivalence<a class="headerlink" href="#equivalence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally (for now), a relation is said to be an <em>equivalence relation</em>
if it is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric. Formally, we can write
this property as a conjunction of the three individual properties:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/38f1bddf350507039ccbfded99e06bd768947643.png" alt="Equivalence(R) \iff Symmetric(R) \land Reflexive(R) \land
Transitive(R)"/>. Equality is the canonical example of an equivalence
relation: it is reflexive (<em>x = x</em>), symmetric (if <em>x = y</em> then <em>y =
x</em>) and transitive (if <em>x = y</em> and <em>y = z</em> then <em>x = z</em>.).</p>
<p>An important property of equivalence relations is that they divide up
a set into subsets of <em>equivalent</em> values. As an example, take the
equivalence relation on people, <em>has same birthday as</em>. Clearly every
person has the same birthday as him or herself; if Joe has the same
birthday as Mary, then Mary has the same birthday as Joe; and if Tom
has the same birthday as mary then Joe necessarily also has the same
birthday as Tom. This relation thus divides the human population into
366 equivalence classes. Mathematicians usually use the notation <em>a ~
b</em> to denote the concept that <em>a</em> is equivalent to <em>b</em> (under whatever
equivalence relation is being considered).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sequences">
<h2>Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#sequences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A sequence of elements is an ordered collection in which elements can
appear zero or more times. In both mathematical writing and in Dafny,
sequences are often denoted as lists of elements enclosed in square
brackets.  The same kinds of elisions (using elipses) can be used as
shorthands in quasi-formal mathematical writing as with set notation.
For example, in Dafny, a sequence <em>s := [1, 2, 3, 1]</em> is a sequence of
integers, of length four, the elements of which can be referred to by
subscripting. So <em>s[0]</em> is <em>1</em>, for example, as is <em>s[3]</em>.</p>
<p>While at first a sequence might seem like an entirely different kind
of thing than a set, in reality a sequence of length, <em>n</em>, is best
understood, and is formalized, as a binary relation. The domain of the
relation is the sequence of natural numbers from <em>0</em> to <em>n-1</em>.  These
are the index values. The relation then associates each such index
value with the value in that position in the sequence. So in reality,
a sequence is a special case of a binary relation, and a binary
relation is, as we’ve seen, just a special case of a set.  So here we
are, at the end of this chapter, closing the loop with where we
started. We have seen that the concept of sets really is a fundamental
concept, and a great deal of other machinery is then built as using
special cases, including relations, maps, and sequences.</p>
<p>Tuples, too, are basically maps from indices to values. Whereas all
the values in a sequence are necessarily of the same type, elements in
a tuple can be of different types. Tuples also use the <em>.n</em> notation
to apply projection functions to tuples. So, again, the value of, say,
<em>(“hello”, 7).1</em> is <em>7</em> (of type <em>int</em>), while the value of
<em>(“hello”, 7).0</em> is the string, “hello.”</p>
