<h1>7. Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Modern mathematics is largely founded on set theory: in particular, on
what is called <em>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of Choice</em>,
or <em>ZFC</em>. Every concept you have ever learnedseen in mathematics can
be reduced to expresions involving sets.  For example, every natural
number can be represented as a set: zero as the <em>empty set</em> (<em>{}</em>);
one as the set containing the empty set (<em>{{}}</em>); two as the set that
contains that set (<em>{{{}}}</em>); ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Set theory includes the treatment of sets and of special cases
involving relations (sets of tuples), functions (sets of tuples that
satisfying the constraint of being <em>single0valued</em>, sequences (sets
with an ordering imposed on the elements, which can in turn be viewed
as a function from natural number indices to set elements) and other
related concepts.  ZFC is a widely accepted <em>formal foundation</em> for
modern mathematics: a set of axioms that describe properties of sets,
from which all the rest of mathematics can be deduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="naive-set-theory">
<h2>Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So what is a set? A <em>naive</em> definition (which will actually be good
enough for our purposes and for most of practical computer science) is
that a set is just an unordered collection of elements. In principle,
these elements are themselves sets, all the way down to empty sets,
but we don’t need to think in such reductionist terms. We can think
about a set of natural number elements, for example, without having to
think of each natural number as itself being some weird kind of set!</p>
<p>In practice, we just think sets as unordered collections of elements
off some kind, where any given element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> any
given set. Membership is binary.  So, for example, when we combine two
sets, each containing some common element, the resulting combined set
will have that element as a member, but it won’t have it twice.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces <em>naive</em>, which is to say <em>intuitive and
practical</em>, set theory. It does not cover <em>axiomatic</em> set theory, in
which every concept is ultimately reduced to a set of logical axioms
that define what precisely it means to be a set and how sets behave.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overly-naive-set-theory">
<h2>Overly Naive Set Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#overly-naive-set-theory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before we go on, however, we review a bit of history to understand
that an overly naive view of sets can lead to logical contradictions
that make naive set theory completely useless as a logically sound
foundation for mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the founders of modern logic, Gotlob Frege, had as his central
mission to establish foundations of mathematics in symbolic logic.
The concept of a set was central to his effort. His logic therefore
allowed one to define sets as collections of elements that satisfy
given propositions, and to talk about whether a given element is in a
given set of not. Frege’s notion of sets, in turn, traced back to the
seminal work of Georg Cantor.</p>
<p>Boom. In 1903, the British analytical philosopher, Bertrand Russell,
published a paper presenting a paradox in what we now call <em>naive set
theory.</em> Russell showed that a logic based on naive set theory would
be <em>inconsistent</em> (self-contradicting) and thus useless as a logic.</p>
<p>To see the problem, one need only consider the set of all sets that do
not contain themselves. In mathematical <em>set comprehension</em> notation,
we would write this set, let’s call it <em>S</em>, as <img class="math" src="_images/math/a1eecde9ec8a7eb381ac82e7ec68e29cf02b3106.png" alt="S = \{ a: set |
a \notin a \}."/> That is, <em>S</em> is the set of elements, <em>a</em>, each itself
a set, such that <em>a</em> is not in (a member of) itself.</p>
<p>Now ask the decisive question: Does <em>S</em> contain itself? Let’s make a
notation, <em>C(S)</em>, to represent the idea that <em>S</em> contains itself. Now
suppose that <em>C(S)</em> is true, i.e., that <em>S</em> does contain itself. In
this case, <em>S</em>, being a set that contains itself, cannot be a member
of <em>S</em>, because we just defined <em>S</em> to be the set of sets that do
<em>not</em> contain themselves. The assumption that <em>S</em> containss itself
leads to the conclusion that <em>S</em> does not contain itself. In logical
terms, <img class="math" src="_images/math/88fed86576b69c7f57881ccfe1f506808ec16b07.png" alt="C(S) \rightarrow \neg C(S)."/> This is a contradiction and
thus a logical impossibility.</p>
<p>Now suppose <em>S</em> does not contain itself: <img class="math" src="_images/math/4a4e43a13b62324114a4b955a446319f03c21fac.png" alt="\neg C(S)."/>. Being
such a set, and given that <em>S</em> is the set of sets that do not contain
themselves, it must now be in <em>S</em>. So <img class="math" src="_images/math/2bf28ffcfdbea32d11c7145b71a2883546e258a6.png" alt="\neg C(S) \rightarrow
C(S)."/> The assumption that it does <em>not</em> contain itself leads right
back to the conclusion that it <em>does</em> contain itself. Either the set
does or does not contain itself, but assuming either case leads to a
contradictory conclusion. All is lost!</p>
<p>That such an internal self-contradiction can arise in such a simple
way (or at all) is a complete disaster for any logic. The whole point
of a logic is that it gives one a way to reason that is sound, which
means that from true premises one can never reach a contradictory
conclusion. If something that is impossible can be proved to be true
in a given theory, then anything at all can be proved to be true, and
the whole notion of truth just collapses into meaninglessness. As soon
as Frege saw Russell’s Paradox, he knew that that was <em>game over</em> for
his profound attempt to base mathematics on a logic grounded in his
(Cantor’s) naive notion of sets.</p>
<p>Two solutions were eventually devised. Russell introduced a notion of
<em>types</em>, as opposed to sets, per se, as a foundation for mathematics.
The basic idea is that one can have elements of a certain <em>type</em>; then
sets of elements of that type, forming a new type; then sets of sets
elements of that type, forming yet another type; but one cannot even
talk about a set containing (or not containing) itself, because sets
can only contain elements of types lower in the type hierarchy.</p>
<p>The concept of types developed by Russell lead indirectly to modern
type theory, which remains an area of very active exploration in both
computer science and pure mathematics. Type theory is being explored
as an alternative foundation for mathematics, and is at the very heart
of a great deal of work going on in the areas of programming language
design and formal software specification and verification.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zermelo repaired the paradox by adjusting some of
the axioms of set theory, to arrive at the starting point of what has
become ZFC. When we work in set theory today, whether with a <em>naive</em>
perspective or not, we are usually working in a set theory the logical
basic of which is ZFC.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sets">
<h2>Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For our purposes, the <em>naive</em> notion of sets will be good enough. We
will take a <em>set</em> to be an unordered finite or infinite collection of
<em>elements</em>. An element is either <em>in</em> or <em>not in</em> a set, and can be in
a set at most once.  In this chapter, we will not encounter any of the
bizarre issues that Russell and others had to consider at the start of
the 20th century.</p>
<p>What we will find is that set-theoretical thinking is an incredibly
powerful intellectual tool. It’s at the heart of program specification
and verification, algorithm design and analysis, and theory of
computing, among many other areas in computer science. Moreover, Dafny
makes set theory not only fun but executable. The logic of Dafny, for
writing assertions, pre- and post-conditions, and invariants <em>is</em> set
theory, a first-order logic with sets and set-related operations as
built-in concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-theory-notations">
<h2>Set Theory Notations<a class="headerlink" href="#set-theory-notations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="display-notation">
<h3>Display notation<a class="headerlink" href="#display-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In everyday mathematical writing, andin Dafny, we denote small sets by
listing the elements of the set within curly brace. If <em>S</em> is the set
containing the numbers, one, two, and three, for example, we can write
<em>S</em> as <img class="math" src="_images/math/681866a8f518adc2b652c8a583e1b642e424b55b.png" alt="\{ 1, 2, 3 \}."/></p>
<p>In Dafny, we would write almost the same thing.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S:set&lt;int&gt; := { 1, 2, 3 }.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code introduces the variable, <em>S</em>, declares that its type is
<em>finite set of integer</em> (<em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em> being the type of <em>infinite</em> sets
of elements of tyep <em>T</em>), and assigns to <em>S</em> the set value, <img class="math" src="_images/math/b7d2529464caa57ee93b6344aa404e3030bb115a.png" alt="\{
1, 2, 3 \}."/> Because the value on the right side of the assignment
operator, is evidently a set of integers, Dafny will infer the type of
<em>S</em>, and the explicit type declaration can therefore be omitted.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var S := { 1, 2, 3 }.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When a set is finite but too large to write down easily as a list of
elements, but when it has a regular structure, mathematicians often
denote such a set using an elipsis. For example, a set, <em>S</em>, of even
natural numbers from zero to one hundred could be written like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/9a00b3fe8646fb985d914bf4e01ecb01aec599d2.png" alt="S = \{ 0, 2, 4, \ldots, 100 \}."/> This expression is a kind of
quasi-formal mathematics. It’s mostly formal but leaves details that
an educated person should be able to infer to the human reader.</p>
<p>It is not (currently) possible to write such expressions in Dafny.
Dafny does not try to fill in missing details in specifications. A
system that does do such a thing might make a good research project.
On the other hand, ordinary mathematical writing as well as Dafny do
have ways to precisely specify sets, including even infinite sets, in
very concise ways, using what is called <em>set comprehension</em> or <em>set
builder</em> notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="set-comprehension-notation">
<h3>Set comprehension notation<a class="headerlink" href="#set-comprehension-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Take the example of the set, <em>S</em>, of even numbers from zero to one
hundred, inclusive. We can denote this set precisely in mathematical
writing as <img class="math" src="_images/math/97e386e4d3ed865d3932349f6a4550a1bf1e4e58.png" alt="S = \{ n: {\mathbb Z} | 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 100 \land n mod 2
== 0 \}."/> Let’s pull this expression apart.</p>
<p>The expression on the right of the equals sign can be read in three
parts. The vertical bar is read <em>such that</em>. To the left of the bar is
an expression identifying the set from which the elements of <em>this</em>
set are drawn, and a name is given to an arbitrary element of this
source set. So here we can say that <em>S</em> is a set each element <em>n</em> of
which is a natural number.  A name, here <em>n</em>, for an arbitrary element
is given for two purposes. First it desribes the form of elements in
the set being built: here just <em>integers</em>. Second, the name can then
be used in writing a condition that must be true of each such element.
That expression is written to the right of the vertical bar.</p>
<p>Here the condition is that each such element, <em>n</em> must be greater than
or equal to zero, less than or equal to one hundred, and even, in that
the remainder must be zero when <em>n</em> is divided by <em>2</em>. The overall set
comprehension expression is thus read literally as, <em>S</em> is the set of
integers, <em>n</em>, such that <em>n</em> is greater than or equal to zero, <em>n</em> is
less than or equal to 100, and <em>n</em> evenly divisible by <em>2</em>. A more
fluent reading would simply be <em>S</em> is the set of even integers between
zero and one hundred inclusive.</p>
<p>Dafny supports set comprehension notations. This same set would be
written as follows (we assume that the type of S has already been
declared to be <em>set&lt;int&gt;)</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 100;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another way to define the same set in ordinary mathematical writing
would use a slightly richer form of set comprehension notation. In
particular, we can define the same set as the set of values of the
expression <em>2*n</em> for <em>n</em> is in the range zero to fifty, inclusive.
Where it’s readily inferred, mathematicians will usually also leave
out explicit type information. <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>S = { 2 * n | 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 50 }. In
this expression it’s inferred that <em>n</em> ranges over all the natural
numbers, these values are <em>filtered</em> by the expression on the right,
and these filtered values are then fed through the expression on the
left of the bar to produce the elements of the intended set.</p>
<p>Dafny also supports set comprehension notation in this style. To
define this very same set in Dafny we could also write this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>S := set s: int | 0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50 :: 2 * s;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command assigns to S a set of values, <em>2 * s</em>,, where <em>s</em>
ranges over the integers and satisfies the predicate (or filter)
<em>0 &lt;= s &lt;= 50</em>.</p>
<p>The collection of values from which element are drawn to be
build into a new set need not just be a built-in type but can
be another programmer-defined set. Given that <em>S</em> is the set
of even numbers from zero to one hundred, we can define the
subset of <em>S</em> of elements that are less than <em>25</em> by writing
a richer set comprehension. In pure mathematical writing, we
could write <img class="math" src="_images/math/9cc14614aedd949a467fd052edd0f4f2e3862dd0.png" alt="T = \{ t | t \in S \land t &lt; 25\}."/> That is,
<em>T</em> is the set of elements that are in <em>S</em> and less than <em>25</em>.
The Dafny notation is a little different, but not too much:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var T := set t | t in S &amp;&amp; t &lt; 25;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This Dafny code defines <em>T</em> to be the set (of integers, but note that
we let Dafny infer the type of <em>t</em> in this case), such that <em>t</em> is in
the set <em>S</em> (that we just defined) and <em>t</em> is also less than <em>25</em>.</p>
<p>As a final example, let’s suppose that we want to define the set of
all ordered pairs whose first elements are from <em>S</em> and whose second
elements are from <em>T</em>, as we’ve defined them here. For example, the
pair <em>(76,24)</em> would be in this set, but not <em>(24 76)</em>. In ordinary
mathematical writing, this would be <img class="math" src="_images/math/6e93c4191ebb0fdc2a5106f5991ef00a0665e9f8.png" alt="\{ (s,t) | s \in S \land t
\in T\}."/> This set is, as we’ll learn more about shortly, called the
<em>product set</em> of the sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In Danfy, this would be written like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var Q := set s, t | s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s, t);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code assigns to the new variable, <em>Q</em>, a set formed by taking
elements, <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>,, such that <em>s</em> is in <em>S</em> and <em>t</em> is in <em>T</em>, and
forming the elements of the new set as tuples, <em>(s, t)</em>. This is a far
easier way to write code for a product set than by explicit iteration
over the sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>!</p>
<p>In Dafny, the way to extract an element of a tuple, <em>t</em>, of arity,
<em>n</em>, is by writing <em>t.n</em>, where <em>n</em> is a natural number in the range
<em>0</em> up to <em>n - 1</em>. So, for example, <em>(3, 4).1</em> evaluates to <em>4</em>. It’s
not a notation that is common to many programming languages. One can
think of it as a kind of subscripting, but using a different notation
than the usual square bracket subscripting used with sequences.</p>

<div class="section" id="cardinality">
<h3>Cardinality<a class="headerlink" href="#cardinality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By the cardinality of a set, <em>S</em>, we mean the number of elements
in S. When <em>S</em> is finite, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is a natural number.
The cardinarily of the empty set is zero, for example, because it has
no (zero) elements. In ordinary mathematics, if <em>S</em> is a finite set,
then its cardinality is denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/bca4eb7c95f7b9bb9f0b55ab74fb48501c374794.png" alt="|S|"/>. With <em>S</em> defined as in
the preceding section, the cardinality of <em>S</em> is <em>50</em>. (There are
<em>50</em> numbers between <em>0</em> and <em>49</em>, inclusive.)</p>
<p>The Dafny notation for set cardinality is just the same. The following
code will print the cardinality of <em>S</em>, namely <em>50</em>, for example.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print |S|;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If a set is infinite in size, as for example is the set of natural
numbers, the cardinality of the set is obviously not any natural
number. One has entered the realm of <em>transfinite numbers</em>. We will
discuss transfinite numbers later in this course. In Dafny, as you
might expect, the cardinality operator is not defined for infinite
sets (of type <em>iset&lt;T&gt;</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="equality">
<h3>Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two sets are considered equal if and only if they contain exactly
the same elements. To assert that sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are equal in
mathematical writing, we would write <em>S = T</em>. In Dafny, such an
assertion would be written, <em>S == T</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subset">
<h3>Subset<a class="headerlink" href="#subset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A set, <em>T</em>, can be said to be a subset of a set <em>S</em> if and only if
every element in <em>T</em> is also in <em>S</em>. In this case, mathematicians
write <img class="math" src="_images/math/006926e4a2b3b3a55129b93b7ab1fedf68da96eb.png" alt="T \subseteq S"/>. In logical notation, we would write,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0e4eb07fe9d633c95c2e21bf6f6f70df946e43f6.png" alt="T \subseteq S \iff \forall t \in T, t \in S"/>. That is, <em>T</em> is a
subset of <em>S</em> if and only if every element in <em>T</em> is also in <em>S</em>.</p>
<p>A set <em>T</em>, is said to be a <em>proper</em> subset of <em>S</em>, if <em>T</em> is a subset
of <em>S</em> but <em>T</em> is not equal to <em>S</em>. This is written in mathematics as
<img class="math" src="_images/math/5e1985f6ce3ef221173377903e0f65930b9412aa.png" alt="T \subset S"/>. In other words, every element of <em>T</em> is in <em>S</em> but
there is at least one element of <em>S</em> that is not in <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>In our example, <em>T</em> (the set of even natural numbers less than <em>25</em>)
is a proper subset of <em>S</em> (the set of even natural numbers less than
or equal to <em>100</em>).</p>
<p>In Dafny, one uses the usual arithmetic less and and less than or
equal operator symbols, <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&lt;=</em>, to assert <em>proper subset</em> and
<em>subset</em> relationships, respectively. The first two of the following
assertions are thus both true in Dafny, but the third is not. That
said, limitations in the Dafny verifier make it hard for Dafny to see
the truth of such assertions without help. We will not discuss how to
provide such help at this point.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert T &lt; S;
assert T &lt;= S;
assert S &lt;= T;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We note every set is a subset, but not a proper subset, of
itself. It’s also the case that the empty set is a subset of every
set, in that <em>all</em> elements in the empty set are in any other set,
because there are none. In logic-speak, we’d say <em>a universally
quantified proposition over an empty set is trivially true.</em></p>
<p>If we reverse the operator, we get the notion of supersets and proper
supersets. If <em>T</em> is a subset of <em>S</em>, then <em>S</em> is a superset of <em>T</em>,
written, <img class="math" src="_images/math/545f54f8cb60943285b183ae5bc52fb0fc87ad16.png" alt="S \supseteq T"/>. If <em>T</em> is a proper subset of <em>S</em> then
<em>S</em> is a proper superset of <em>T</em>, written <img class="math" src="_images/math/65e6f407c7dfce0fa7d0f9e6db27595235e657f2.png" alt="S \supset T"/>. In
Dafny, the greater than and greater than or equals operator are used
to denote proper superset and superset relationships between sets.
So, for example, <em>S &gt;= T</em> is the assertion that <em>S</em> is a superset of
<em>T</em>. Note that every set is a superset of itself, but never a proper
superset of itself, and every set is a superset of the empty set.</p>

<div class="section" id="intersection">
<h3>Intersection<a class="headerlink" href="#intersection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The intersection, <img class="math" src="_images/math/5391bb4cd9797217ba8e85da016c08f73cf66ba9.png" alt="S \cap T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the
set of elements that are in both <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. Mathematically speaking,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/b93e4637c8680497c56648862807d1a3965cacd8.png" alt="S \cap T = \{ e~|~e \in S \land e \in T \}"/>. In Dafny, the <em>*</em>
operator is used for set intersection.  The intersection of <em>S</em> and
<em>T</em> is thus written <em>S * T</em>. For example, the command <em>Q := S * T</em>
assigns the intersection of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the new value of <em>Q</em>.</p>

<h3>Union<a class="headerlink" href="#union" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The union, <img class="math" src="_images/math/10bb12eb90bac33ab070fa2ff9405b721df1230e.png" alt="S \cup T"/>, of two sets, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, is the set of

operator is used for set union.  The unionof <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is thus
written <em>S + T</em>. For example, the command <em>V := S + T</em> assigns the
union of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> as the new value of <em>V</em>.</p>

<h3>Difference<a class="headerlink" href="#difference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difference, <em>S\T</em> (<em>S</em> minus <em>T</em>), of sets <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is the set

to denote set difference, as in the expression, <em>S - T</em>. Operators in
Dafny can be applied to sets to make up more complex expressions. So,
for example, <em>|S-T|</em> denotes the cardinality of <em>S-T</em>.</p>

<p>The product set, <img class="math" src="_images/math/64a6eff94bb737b50c491df7ab889fd0c11ecb02.png" alt="S \times T"/>, is the set of all the ordered

is the product of the cardinalities of the individual sets.</p>
<p>There is no product set operator, per se, in Dafny, but given sets,
<em>S</em> and <em>T</em> a product set can easily be expressed using Dafny’s set
comprehension notation: <em>set s, t: s in S &amp;&amp; t in T :: (s,t)</em>. The
keyword, <em>set</em>, is followed by the names of the variables that will be
used to form the set comprehension expression, followed by a colon,
followed by an assertion that selects the values of <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> that

finally an expression using the local variables that states how each

<h3>Power Set<a class="headerlink" href="#power-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The power set of a set, <em>S</em>, denoted <img class="math" src="_images/math/13c471ff6a4226c1aeff17f10d4693215420d207.png" alt="{\mathbb P}(S),"/> is the
set of all subsets of <em>S</em>. If <em>S = {1, 2 }</em>, for example, the powerset
of <em>S</em> is the set containing the proper and improper subsets of <em>S</em>,
namely <em>{}, { 1 }, { 2 },</em> and <em>{ 1, 2}</em>.</p>
<p>The powerset of a set with <em>n</em> element will have <img class="math" src="_images/math/798d39775b3c54beddeb31ad508597409e6e7c43.png" alt="2^n"/> elements.
Consider the powerset of the empty set. The only subset of the empty
set is the empty set itself, so the powerset of the empty set is the
set containing only the empty set. This set has just <em>1</em> element. It’s
cardinality thus satisfies the rule, as <em>2</em> to the power, zero (the
number of elements in the empty set), is <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that for every set, <em>S</em>, with cardinality <em>n</em>, the
cardinality of its powerset is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>. Consider a set, <em>S’</em>,
of cardinality one bigger than that of <em>S</em>. Its powerset contains
every set in the powerset of <em>S</em>, plus every set in that set with the
new element included, and that’s all the element it includes.</p>
<p>The number of sets in the powerset of <em>S’</em> is thus double the number
of sets in the powerset of <em>S</em>. Given that the cardinality of the
powerset of <em>S</em> is <em>2</em> to the <em>n</em>, the cardinality of <em>S’</em>, being
twice that number, is <em>2</em> to the <em>n + 1</em>.</p>
<p>Now because the rule holds for sets of size zero, and whenver it holds
for sets of size <em>n</em> it also holds for sets of size <em>n + 1</em>, it must
hold for sets of every (finite) size. So what we have is an informal
<em>proof by induction</em> of a theorem: <img class="math" src="_images/math/6286656ea11925e78858a3878bc9be8a2866eeb9.png" alt="\forall S, |{\mathbb P}(S)|
= 2^{|S|}"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, there is no explicit powerset operator, one taking a set and
returning its powerset, but the concept can be expressed in an
extremely elegant form using a set comprehension notation (in both
pure mathematics and in Dafny). The solution is to say simple the set
of all sets that are subsets of a given set, <em>S</em>. The follwing three
line program prints out the powerset of <em>S = { 1, 2, 3 }</em>.  The key
expression is to the right of the assignment operator on the second
line.</p>

<div class="section" id="tuples">
<h2>Tuples<a class="headerlink" href="#tuples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tuple is an ordered collection of elements. The number of elements
in a tuple is called its <em>arity</em>. Ordered pairs are of arity, <em>2</em>. An
ordered triple is of arity, <em>3</em>. A tuple of arity <em>2</em> is called an
<em>ordered pair</em>. A tuple of arity <em>3</em> is often called a triple. For a
larger arity, <em>n</em>, a tuple with that arity is called an <em>n-tuple</em>.
The tuple, <em>(7, X, “house”, square_func)</em>, for example, can be said
to be a <em>4-tuple</em>.</p>
<p>The elements of a tuple are in general not of the same type, or drawn
from the same sets. In the example here, the first element appears to
be an integer, the second, a variable, the third, a string, and last,
the name of some function.</p>
<p>Tuples are properly understood as values taken from a set product.  If
<em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are our sets of even numbers between zero and one hundred,
and zero and twenty four, respectively, for example, then the ordered
pair, <em>(60,24)</em> is an element of the product set <img class="math" src="_images/math/64a6eff94bb737b50c491df7ab889fd0c11ecb02.png" alt="S \times T"/>.</p>
<p>If one is being careful about types, whether in general mathematical
discourse or in programming, then the <em>type</em> of a tuple is defined as
the tuple of the types of its elements. In the example here, the type
of <em>S</em> (using Dafny notation) is <em>set&lt;int&gt;</em>, and the type of <em>T</em> is
also <em>set&lt;int&gt;</em>, so the type of elements in <img class="math" src="_images/math/64a6eff94bb737b50c491df7ab889fd0c11ecb02.png" alt="S \times T"/> is the
type, <em>(int, int)</em>. In general the type of a tuple in a set product,
::<cite>S_1 times S_2 times ldots time S_n</cite>, where the types of these
sets are <img class="math" src="_images/math/a25f27eaf855f40709db99b90e3b307f237b9c35.png" alt="T_1, \ldots, T_n"/> is <img class="math" src="_images/math/7e39648e05d3ef616da80fbd0df396bf2e63be58.png" alt="(T_1, \ldots, T_n)"/>.</p>
<p>While all of this might seem a little abstract, it’s actually simple
and very useful. Any table of data, such as a table with columns that
hold names, birthdays, and social security numbers, represents data in
a product set. One set is the set of names, the second set is the set
of birthdays. The third is the set of social security numbers.  Each
row in such a table is just a particular tuple in such a set product.</p>
<p>Each row is a tuple. We call each element of a tuple a <em>field</em>. An
<em>n-tuple</em> will have <em>n</em> fields, which we conventionally refer to by
indices ranging from <em>0</em> to <em>n-1</em>.</p>
<p>We are often interested in the value of a particular field of a
tuple. We can used subscripting as a way to extract the value of a
particular field from a tuple. We can view such an extraction
operation as a function from tuple values to field values. We call
such functions <em>projection functions</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>n-tuple</em> will have <em>n</em> project functions, often denoted using the
greek letter, <em>pi</em>, with a (zero-based) subscript indicating which
element the project function <em>projects</em> out of a given tuple. If for
example, <em>t</em> is the <em>3-tuple</em>, <em>12, 4, 6)</em>, then <img class="math" src="_images/math/209832ca41dbb8f55ee31310b9e8f1b7a7d3b678.png" alt="\pi_1(t) = 4"/>.</p>
<p>In Dafny, tuples are written as they are in mathematics, as lists of
field values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.  For
example <em>t := (1, “hello”, [1,2,3])” assigns to *t</em> a <em>3-tuple</em> whose
first field has the value, <em>1</em> (of type <em>int</em>); whose second field has
the value, “hello”, a string; and whose third element is the list of
integers, <em>[2, 4, 6]</em>. Projection in Dafny is accomplished using the
subscripting operation. So, for example, <em>t[1]</em> in this case has the
value, <em>4</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relations">
<h2>Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A relation in nothing but a subset of (the tuples in) a product set. A
table such as the one described will, in practice, usually not have a
row with every possible combination of names, birthdays, and SSNs. In
other words, it won’t contain every tuple in the product of the sets
from which the values in the respective columns are drawn (the set of
all names, the set of all birthdays, and the set of all SSNs in this
case).</p>
<p>In mathematical writing, we will thus often see a sentence of the
form, Let <img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/> be a relation. All this says
is that <em>R</em> is some subset of the set of all tuples in the product set
of <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>. If <em>S = { hot, cold }</em> and <em>T = { cat, dog }</em>, then
the product set is <em>{ (hot, cat), (hot, dog), (cold, cat), (cold, dog)
}</em>, and a relation on <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> is any subset of this product set.
The set, <em>{ (hot, cat), (cold, dog) }</em> is one such relation.</p>
<p>Here’s an exercise. If <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are finite sets, <em>|S| = n</em> and <em>|T|
= m</em>, how many relations are there over <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>? First, how many
tuples are in the product set? Second, how many subsets are there of
that set? For fun, write a little Dafny program. should take two sets
of integers as arguments as return the number of relations over them.
Dafny does not provide a built-in exponentiation funciton, but you can
now write one yourself (in fact, you’ve already done this). Here’s a
test case: the number of relations over sets of cardinalities <em>4</em> and
<em>5</em> is about a million.</p>

<div class="section" id="binary-relations-and-functions">
<h2>Binary Relations and Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#binary-relations-and-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Binary relations are relations over products of <em>2</em> sets. The first
set is called the <em>domain</em> of the relation. The second set is called
the co-domain of the relation. That is, a binary relation is a subset
of the ordered pairs in a product of the given domain and codomain
sets.</p>
<p>The everyday functions you have studies in mathematics are binary
relations, albeit usually infinite ones. For example, the <em>square</em>
function, that associates every real number with its square can be
understood as the infinite set of ordered pairs of real numbers in
which the second is the square of the first. Mathematically this is
:{ (x, y) | y = x^2 }:<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`</span></a>, where we take as implicit that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>
range over the real numbers. Elements of this set include the pairs,
<em>(-2, 4)</em> and <em>(2, 4)</em>.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>square roots</em> of real numbers is also best understood
as a relation. The tuples are again pairs of real numbers, but now the
elements include tuples, <em>(4, 2)</em> and <em>(4, -2)</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="functions-are-single-value-binary-relations">
<h3>Functions are Single-Value Binary Relations<a class="headerlink" href="#functions-are-single-value-binary-relations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary-relation is said to be <em>single-valued</em> if it does not have
two tuples with the same first element and different second elements.
A different way to say this is that if <em>(x, y)</em> and <em>(x, z)</em> are two
elements in a single-valued binary relation (with the same first
element, <em>x</em>) then it must be that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are the same value, for
otherwise the relation would not be single-valued. To be more precise,
then, a relation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/8976c2854fcacf02af1366971f1c7b69eb0420e4.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times T"/>, is single valued if
<img class="math" src="_images/math/b15ef2125a9f9a15f3490083eca8ccbf873ef604.png" alt="forall (x, y) \in R, forall (x, z) \in R, y = z"/>. In logical
notation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/6e58633bedbd3498fea2acffa1aa2a225547cb16.png" alt="(x, y) \in R \land (x, z) \in R \rightarrow y = z"/>.</p>
<p>A single-valued binary relation is also called a <em>function</em>. And by a
<em>function</em> in mathematics, we means exactly a single-valued relation.
The <em>square</em> relation is a function, in that for any given number
there is only one associated square of that number. The relation is
single-valued in exactly this sense. By contrast, the square root
relation is not a function, because for any given non-negative real
number, there are two associated square roots. The relation is not
single-valued.</p>
<p>There are several ways to represent functions in Dafny, or in most any
other modern programming language. In Dafny one can represent a
function as a pure functional program, one can use a method, but for
our purposes here, it is the representation of a function from values
of type <em>S</em> to values of type <em>T</em> as a <em>map&lt;S,T&gt;</em> that is pertinent.
A map is nothing other than an explicit representation of a function
as a set of pairs.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a method (or a function) that when given a map&lt;S,T&gt; as
an argument returns a set&lt;(T,S)&gt; as a result where the return result
represents the <em>inverse</em> of the map. The inverse of a function is not
necessarily a function so the inverse of a map cannot be represented
as a map, in general. Rather, we represent the inverse just as a set
of <em>(S,T)</em> tuples.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a pure function that when given a set of ordered pairs
returns true if, viewed as a relation, the set is also a function, and
that returns false, otherwise.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a function or method that takes a set of ordered pairs
with a pre-condition requiring that the set satisfy the predicate from
the preceding exercise and that then returns a <em>map</em> that contains the
same set of pairs as the given set.</p>
<p>Exercise: Write a function that takes a map as an argument and that
returns true if the function that it represents is invertible and that
otherwise returns false. Then write a function that takes a map
satisfying the precondition that it be invertible and that in this
case returns its inverse, also as a map.</p>

<div class="section" id="total-vs-partial">
<h3>Total vs Partial<a class="headerlink" href="#total-vs-partial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation is said to be total if every element of its domain
appears as the first element in at least one tuple. We say that the
relation is <em>defined</em> for each such element. A relation that is not
total is said to be partial. And these terms are applied to functions
as well.</p>
<p>Exercises: Is the function <em>y = x</em> on the real numbers total? Is the
square root function on the domain of the real numbers total? Answer:
No, because it’s not defined for any real numbers less than zero. Is
the <em>log</em> function defined on the non-negative real numbers? Answer:
no, because it’t not defined at <em>x = 0</em>.  Is the <em>SSN</em> function, that
assigns a U.S. social security number to a person total? No, not every
person has a social security number.</p>
<p>Implementing partial functions as methods or pure function in software
presents certain problems. Either a pre-conditions has to be enforced
to prevent the function of method being called with a value for which
it’s not define, or the function or method needs to be made total by
returning some kind of <em>error</em> value if it’s called with such a value.
In this case, callers of the function are obligated always to check
whether <em>some</em> real function value was return or whether <em>none</em> was,
but rather an error flag. The failure of programmers systematically to
check for such error returns is a ubiquitous source of bugs in real
software.</p>
<p>By enforcing a requirement that every loop and recursion terminates,
Dafny demands that every function and method be total in the sense
that it returns and that it returns some value of the type, if any,
that it promises to return. When a Dafny total function is used to
implement a mathematical function that is partial, the problem thus
arises what to return for inputs not in the domain of the partial
function being implemented. A little later in the course we will see a
nice way to handle this issue using what are called <em>option</em> types. An
option type is like a box that contains either a good value or an
error flag; and to get a good value out of such a box, one must
explicitly check to see whether the box has a good value in it or,
alternatively, and error flag.</p>

<div class="section" id="inverse">
<h3>Inverse<a class="headerlink" href="#inverse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The inverse of a given binary relation is simply the set of tuples
formed by reversing the order of all of the given tuples. To put this
in mathematical notation, if <em>R</em> is a relation, its inverse, denoted
::<cite>R^{-1}</cite>, is <img class="math" src="_images/math/6b8262e547923c6ac102733ab306db06ec2c58d2.png" alt="\{ (y, x) | (x, y) \in R \}"/>. You can see this
immediately in our example of squares and square roots. One contains
the tuples, <em>(-2, 4), (2, 4)</em>, while the other contains <em>(4, 2), (4,
-2)</em>.</p>
<p>It should immediately be clear that the inverse of a function is not
always also a function. Indeed, the inverse of the square function is
the square root relation, but that relation is not itself a function.</p>
<p>A function whose inverse is also a function is said to be invertible.
The function, <em>f(x) = x</em> (or <em>y = x</em> if you prefer) is invertible in
this sense. In fact, its inverse is itself. Is the cube root function
invertible? (That’s an exercise for the reader. Now prove it with a

<h3>Injective<a class="headerlink" href="#injective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A relation (and in particular, a function) is said to be injective if
no two elements of the domain are associated with the same element in
the co-domain.</p>
<p>The square function is a function because it is single-valued, but it
is not injective. To see this, one need only to observe that two
different values in the domain, <em>-2</em> and <em>2</em>, have the same squared
value in the co-domain, namely <em>4</em>.</p>

<h3>Surjective<a class="headerlink" href="#surjective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation, and in particular a function, is <em>surjective</em> if
every element in the co-domain appears in some tuple in the relation.
In other words, the <em>range</em> of the relation or function, which one can
think about as the set of output values, <em>covers</em> the co-domain. The
function, <em>f(x) = x</em> (or <em>y = x</em> if you prefer), where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are
real numbers, is surjective, because for every possible value of <em>y</em>
there is some <em>x</em> such that <em>f(x) = y</em>. By contrast, the function,
<em>f(x) = sin(x)</em>, viewed as a function from the real numbers (on the
x-axis) to real numbers (on the y-axis) is not surjective, because the
“output” values of this function are constrained to the range <em>[0,1]</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bijective">
<h3>Bijective<a class="headerlink" href="#bijective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A function (already a single-valued relation), is said to be
<em>bjective</em> if it is also both injective and surjective. Such a
function is also often called a <em>bijection</em>. A bijection estabishes a
one-to-one correspondence between elements of two sets. Each element
in the domain maps to a different element in the co-domain (injective)
and every element in the co-domain is mapped to be some element in the
domain (surjective). Therefore, it is also the case that every element
in the co-domain can be mapped back to the single element that mapped
to it. So the inverse of a bijection is also a function and is also a
bijection. Bijections can only be established between sets of the same
size.</p>
<p>Exercise: Make a rigorous argument that that last stement is true.
Try showing that the assumption that you can establish a bijection
between sets of different sizes leads to some kind of contradiction.</p>
<p>Exercise: How many distinct bijections are there between two sets each
of cardinality <em>3</em>? Generalize: how many bijections are there between
two sets of cardinality <em>k</em>? Hint: Pick a first element in the first
set. There are <em>n</em> ways to map it to some element in the second
set. For the second element in the first set, there are only <em>(n-1)</em>
ways, as one cannot map it to the element chosen in the first step, as
that would violate the injectivity property. Continue this line of
reasoning until you get down to all elements having been mapped.</p>

<h3>Reflexive<a class="headerlink" href="#reflexive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We now consider properties of certiain special kinds of binary

relation that maps real numbers to real numbers is a subset of
<img class="math" src="_images/math/0fe9cb77c7db298a4025875b7744e197f8edf6dd.png" alt="{\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb R}"/>, for example. The <em>friends</em>
relation on a social network site associates people with people.</p>
<p>Such a relation is said to be <em>reflexive</em> if (perhaps among other
properties) it (at least) associates every element with itself.  The
equality relation (e.g., on real numbers) is the “canonical” example
of a reflexive relation. It associates every number with itself and
with no other number. The tuples of the equality relation on real
numbers thus includes <em>(2.5, 2.5)</em> and (-3.0, -3.0)* but definitely
not <em>(2.5, -3.0)</em>.</p>
<p>In more mathematical terms, consider a set <em>S</em> and a bindary relation,

reflexive, which we can write as <em>Reflexive(R)</em>, iff and only if for

in this relation becaue <em>2</em> is less than or equal to <em>3</em>, and so is
<em>3</em>, but <em>(4,3)</em> is not in this relation, because <em>4</em> isn’t less than

<h3>Symmetric<a class="headerlink" href="#symmetric" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A binary relation, <em>R</em>, on a set <em>S</em> is said to be <em>symmetric</em> if
whenever the tuple <em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>R</em>, the tuple, <em>(y,x)</em> is in <em>R</em> as

<img class="math" src="_images/math/badf8967a9e750fa49296dc504efdd8360424458.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times S"/>, then <img class="math" src="_images/math/a983ca479a92d849d74c93ab3558691789025821.png" alt="Symmetric(R) \iff \forall
(x,y) \in R, (y,x) \in R"/>.</p>
<p>Question: is the function <em>y = x</em> symmetric? How about the <em>square</em>
function? In an electric circuit, if a conducting wire connects
terminal <em>T</em> to terminal <em>Q</em>, it also connects terminal <em>Q</em> to
terminal <em>T</em> in the sense that electricity doesn’t care which way it
flows over the wire. Is the <em>connects</em> relation in electronic circuits
symmetric? If <em>A</em> is <em>near</em> <em>B</em> then <em>B</em> is <em>near</em> <em>A</em>. Is <em>nearness</em>
symmetric? In the real work is the <em>has-crush-on</em> relation symmetric?</p>

<h3>Transitive<a class="headerlink" href="#transitive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given a binary relation <img class="math" src="_images/math/badf8967a9e750fa49296dc504efdd8360424458.png" alt="R \subseteq S \times S"/>, <em>R</em> is said to
be transitive if whenever <em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>R</em> and <em>(y,z)</em> is in <em>R</em>,
then <em>(x,z)</em> is also in <em>R</em>. Formally, <img class="math" src="_images/math/2209188eabeeb58472953f1513897f62a1f1a32c.png" alt="Transitive(R) \iff
forall (x,y) in R, \forall (y,z) \in R, (x,z) \in R"/>.</p>
<p>Exercise: Is equality transitive? That is, if <em>a = b</em> and <em>b = c</em> it
is also necessarily the case that <em>a = c</em>? Answer: Sure, any sensible
notion of an equality relation has this transitivity property.</p>
<p>Exercise: What about the property of being less than? If <em>a &lt; b</em> and
<em>b &lt; c</em> is it necessarily the case that <em>a &lt; c</em>? Answer: again,
yes. The less than, as well as the less than or equal, and greater
then, and the greater than or equal relations, are all transitive.</p>
<p>How about the <em>likes</em> relation amongst real people. If Harry likes
Sally and Sally likes Bob does Harry necesarily like Bob, too? No, the
human “likes” relation is definitely not transitive. (And this is the
cause of many a tragedy.)</p>

<h3>Equivalence<a class="headerlink" href="#equivalence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Finally (for now), a relation is said to be an <em>equivalence relation</em>
if it is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric. Formally, we can write
this property as a conjunction of the three individual properties:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/38f1bddf350507039ccbfded99e06bd768947643.png" alt="Equivalence(R) \iff Symmetric(R) \land Reflexive(R) \land
Transitive(R)"/>. Equality is the canonical example of an equivalence
relation: it is reflexive (<em>x = x</em>), symmetric (if <em>x = y</em> then <em>y =
x</em>) and transitive (if <em>x = y</em> and <em>y = z</em> then <em>x = z</em>.).</p>
<p>An important property of equivalence relations is that they divide up
a set into subsets of <em>equivalent</em> values. As an example, take the
equivalence relation on people, <em>has same birthday as</em>. Clearly every
person has the same birthday as him or herself; if Joe has the same
birthday as Mary, then Mary has the same birthday as Joe; and if Tom
has the same birthday as mary then Joe necessarily also has the same
birthday as Tom. This relation thus divides the human population into
366 equivalence classes. Mathematicians usually use the notation <em>a ~
b</em> to denote the concept that <em>a</em> is equivalent to <em>b</em> (under whatever
equivalence relation is being considered).</p>

<h2>Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#sequences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A sequence of elements is an ordered collection in which elements can
appear zero or more times. In both mathematical writing and in Dafny,
sequences are often denoted as lists of elements enclosed in square
brackets.  The same kinds of elisions (using elipses) can be used as
shorthands in quasi-formal mathematical writing as with set notation.
For example, in Dafny, a sequence <em>s := [1, 2, 3, 1]</em> is a sequence of
integers, of length four, the elements of which can be referred to by
subscripting. So <em>s[0]</em> is <em>1</em>, for example, as is <em>s[3]</em>.</p>
<p>While at first a sequence might seem like an entirely different kind
of thing than a set, in reality a sequence of length, <em>n</em>, is best
understood, and is formalized, as a binary relation. The domain of the
relation is the sequence of natural numbers from <em>0</em> to <em>n-1</em>.  These
are the index values. The relation then associates each such index
value with the value in that position in the sequence. So in reality,
a sequence is a special case of a binary relation, and a binary
relation is, as we’ve seen, just a special case of a set.  So here we
are, at the end of this chapter, closing the loop with where we
started. We have seen that the concept of sets really is a fundamental
concept, and a great deal of other machinery is then built as using
special cases, including relations, maps, and sequences.</p>
<p>Tuples, too, are basically maps from indices to values. Whereas all
the values in a sequence are necessarily of the same type, elements in
a tuple can be of different types. Tuples also use the <em>.n</em> notation
to apply projection functions to tuples. So, again, the value of, say,
<em>(“hello”, 7).1</em> is <em>7</em> (of type <em>int</em>), while the value of
<em>(“hello”, 7).0</em> is the string, “hello.”</p>
