An algebra is a set, A, of values of some type, along with a number of 
functions, f_i, that are closed over A. By the phrase, closed over A, 
we mean that each such functions takes values in A as its arguments and 
returns values in A as its results.

In this chapter, we make this concept clear through the study of two 
important examples: Boolean algebra and the arithmetic of natural numbers. 
We characterize each algebra by first defining its set, A, of values, and 
by then defining a set of functions that are closed on that particular set.

In the course of studying these two simple algebras, for which you already 
have strong intuition, we will encounter two of the most interesting and
useful ideas in all of computer science  and discrete mathematics: the 
inductive definition of sets of values, which we will call types, and the 
recursive definition of functions taking and returning values of such  types.
